TODO List
=========

Not in priority order.

* Produce a user manual.
* Produce a developer manual.
* Review the javadocs and fix them; add javadoc for each package.
* Fix symbolic arrays.
* Branch on class initialization (do we really want that?).
* Improve abstract support to strings and maps.
* Invokedynamic, lambda.
* Merge Algo\_GETX and Algo\_PUTX (and consequently merge Algo\_GETFIELD and Algo\_PUTFIELD and merge Algo\_GETSTATIC and Algo\_PUTSTATIC).
* Add division-by-zero case in Algo\_XDIV and Algo\_XREM.
* Support SMTLIB bitvector + FP standards (when they will be consolidated).
* Use logging for output.
* Change configuration files format and make all parameters configurable through file.
* Many, many more unit/integration/system tests.
* Multithreaded analysis.
* Use full classpath scanning for reference resolution.
* Add license and copyright at the beginning of each source file.
* Fix all the remaining TODOs in the source.
* Run Findbugs, Checkstyle, PMD and improve the quality of code.
* Run Structure101 and improve the architecture of the code.
* Possibly add interface to [PTC-solver](https://github.com/echancrure/PTC-Solver.git).
